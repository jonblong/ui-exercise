# SalesLoft UI Exercise

## About This Project
This is a rough clone of the Gmail web client built with React (and a lot of coffee). It allows the user to view a list of emails provided in the `/gmail-clone/src/data/emails.json` file. The user may select one or more emails to delete or mark as read/unread. The user can also star emails, with the ability to filter their inbox and display just these emails. The emails can also be filtered by their tags.

There are a few elements (like the search bar and hamburger menu) that don't have functionality. The ability to compose or send emails is not present.
